/// <para>
/// A combobox lets the user type, so it can be answered with something that is on no list. That is a
/// legitimate design (a "city" box that accepts anywhere), which is why this is opt-in rather than
/// implied by the field type — and why it reports the answer instead of quietly discarding it, exactly
/// as a value the model cannot accept is reported rather than swallowed.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// A field whose choices come from an <see cref="BlazorFormFieldDefinition.OptionsProvider"/> is not
/// checked: the list is loaded into the form's runtime state, not into the schema, so at rule time
/// there is nothing here to compare against and failing every answer would be worse than checking
/// none. Validate those on the server, where the same lookup lives.
