/// This is the piece that is otherwise written four times in every application, always slightly
/// differently: a validator that rejects <c>" a@b.com "</c> is technically right and useless, and

/// It runs when the user <em>leaves</em> the field, and again over every field on submit — never on
/// each keystroke, which would eat the space between two words as it is typed and put the caret
/// somewhere the user did not leave it.
